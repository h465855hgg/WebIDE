## 🤝 Contribution
Null

This project is currently open source, but as it's an experimental AI-collaborative development project, the author has stopped maintenance. Developers interested in continuing to improve and extend functionality are welcome.

**Author's Wishlist**
- Build app [complete]
- Toolbar
- Stronger code completion
- Real-time code error checking
- Add debugging functionality to preview interface
- Implement DevServer for preview interface

- Create about page, changelog, etc.

## 💡 Project Significance

This project is a feature-incomplete Android development WebIDE. The original idea was to redefine the name 'WebIDE', but it was eventually abandoned due to mobile performance limitations.

It demonstrates:
- AI capabilities in complex software development
- Specialization of different AI models in specific domains
- The potential of AI-assisted development in the future
